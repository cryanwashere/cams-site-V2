I have always loved the intersection between technology and life sciences,
            and that is why I am drawn to artifical neural networks. Artificial neural
            networks roughly simulate the way that biological neural networks (like your
            brain) propogate information. In my mind, the fact that 
            artificial neural networks can perform heuristic tasks that your brain does
            (such as reading text) shows that they reveal some hidden, universal 
            geometry of intelligence.
