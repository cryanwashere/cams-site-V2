                I have always loved the intersection between technology and life sciences,
                and that is why I am drawn to artifical neural networks. Artificial neural
                networks roughly simulate the way that biological neural networks (like your
                brain) propogate information. In my mind, the fact that 
                artificial neural networks can perform heuristic tasks that your brain does
                (such as reading text) shows that they reveal some hidden, universal 
                geometry of intelligence.

           The last tensor in the neural network represent's its guess as to what the number
           that it is looking at is. Hopefully, the index of the output vector that is the 
           brightest should correspond to the correct digit. During training, the backpropogation 
           algorithm matematically optimizes the weights in the convolutional filters to 
           light up the correct number in the output vector for every number that it sees, thus 
           causing the neural network to "learn".

            I am very interested in the idea of studying proteins <i>in silico</i>, or 
            in other words on a computer. Inspired by programming I have done for the
            Bioinformatics lab at R.I.T. I have made a protein viewer that works in your 
            browser.

            When you learned about enzymes in biology class, you probably were shown boring
            blobs on a screen, and were not very interested. This enzyme is a type of 
            Mitochondrial ATP-Synthase, which synthesizes ATP from a proton gradient in
            the mitochondrias in your cells.

            This is enzyme works like a tiny water wheel, forcing ATP molecules together,
            with the energy of protons flowing through it. It is fascinating to think of 
            how this mechanism evolved on a tiny scale, and 1.5 billion years ago, and 
            is strikingly similar to mechanisms that humans have invented.
