    I have a bunch of Jupyter notebooks that I made to satisfy my own curiosity. You can look at them here





    <ul>
        <li> <a href="gradient_visualization.html">Gradient Visualization</a> This is based on my curiosity of how the weights of a neural network change during the training process. Here I train a very simple neural net on MNIST, and I try to do some analysis on how the weights are changing. I do this by creating a simple dimensionality reduction method. </li>
        <li> <a href="diffusion.html">Diffusion</a> I tried to create a very simple diffusion model</li>
    </ul>
